    <p class="lead">I design proteins that kill drug-resistant bacteria and engineer viral vectors that deliver life-saving gene therapies. My work spans from computational predictions to clinical validation.</p>
    <p>At Children's Medical Research Institute in Sydney, I've helped develop AAV vectors that improve CAR-T cell therapy—making it easier to modify immune cells to fight cancer. We tested these vectors in actual human liver tissue kept alive outside the body, giving us unprecedented insight into how treatments will work in patients. This isn't typical preclinical research; it's as close as we can get to human trials without treating patients.</p>
    <p>My antimicrobial work takes a different approach: I engineer proteins with multiple functional domains that work like molecular Swiss Army knives. Each domain has a specific job—some punch holes in bacterial membranes, others prevent biofilm formation, and some recruit the immune system. By combining these modules, I create customized weapons against specific infections. One of these proteins now coats medical surfaces to prevent bacterial growth.</p>

      <h3>AI-Driven Protein Design</h3>
      <p>I use deep learning models to predict how protein sequences fold and function. For antimicrobials, this means finding sequences that selectively disrupt bacterial membranes while leaving human cells untouched. The key is training on real experimental data—not just computational predictions.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="research-card">
      <h3>From Screen to Clinic</h3>
      <p>Every computational prediction gets tested in the lab. I express proteins in E. coli, purify them, and test against panels of drug-resistant bacteria. The proteins that work move to animal models. It's a numbers game—we test hundreds to find the few that could become drugs.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="research-card">
      <h3>Gene Therapy Delivery</h3>
      <p>AAV vectors are the workhorses of gene therapy, but they often miss their targets. I engineer their capsid proteins to improve targeting—like adding a GPS to ensure therapeutic genes reach the right cells. My recent work improved AAV delivery to generate CAR-T cells more efficiently.</p>

      <h3>Making CAR-T Therapy Accessible: Engineering Better Viral Vectors</h3>
      <p class="pub-details">Tailoring capsid-directed evolution technology for improved AAV-mediated CAR-T generation</p>
      <p class="pub-journal"><em>Molecular Therapy</em></p>
      <p class="pub-description">CAR-T therapy costs $500,000 per patient because it requires extracting, modifying, and reinfusing T cells. I engineered AAV vectors that can reprogram T cells directly in the patient's body—potentially dropping the cost by 100-fold while improving safety.</p>

      <h3>A Living Test Bed: Human Livers Outside the Body</h3>
      <p class="pub-details">Harnessing whole human liver ex situ normothermic perfusion for preclinical AAV vector evaluation</p>
      <p class="pub-journal"><em>Nature Communications</em></p>
      <p class="pub-description">Animal models fail to predict 90% of drug failures in humans. We kept donated human livers alive and functioning outside the body for 24 hours, then tested how AAV vectors infect human hepatocytes. This revealed critical differences from mouse models that explain why many gene therapies fail in clinical trials.</p>

      <h3>Medical Devices That Fight Back Against Bacteria</h3>
      <p class="pub-details">Antibiofilm surfaces based on the immobilization of a novel recombinant antimicrobial multidomain protein</p>
      <p class="pub-journal"><em>Materials Advances</em></p>
      <p class="pub-description">Hospital-acquired infections kill 99,000 Americans yearly, many from biofilms on medical devices. I created a protein coating that kills bacteria on contact while preventing biofilm formation. In lab tests, it reduced bacterial colonization by 99.9% and remained active for 30 days.</p>

      <p class="pub-details">Sequence edition of single domains modulates the final immune and antimicrobial potential of multidomain recombinant proteins</p>
      <p class="pub-journal"><em>Scientific Reports</em></p>
      <p class="pub-description">I discovered that antimicrobial protein domains work better together than alone—but only in specific combinations. By testing 48 different arrangements, I found that domain order matters: putting the membrane-disrupting domain first increased killing efficiency 10-fold against MRSA.</p>
