# Portfolio Performance Optimization Report

**Date:** August 22, 2025  
**Optimization Version:** v2.2.0  
**Conducted by:** Claude Code Assistant  

## Executive Summary

This comprehensive performance audit and optimization resulted in significant improvements across all Core Web Vitals metrics and general performance indicators. The optimizations focused on bundle size reduction, resource loading strategies, memory leak prevention, and enhanced caching mechanisms.

## üìä Performance Metrics - Before/After

## üîß Technical Implementation Details

### Code Splitting Configuration

```javascript
// Enhanced Rollup configuration in astro.config.mjs
manualChunks: id => {
  if (id.includes('node_modules')) {
    if (id.includes('react') || id.includes('react-dom')) {
      return 'vendor-react';
    }
    if (id.includes('d3')) {
      return 'vendor-d3';
    }
    return 'vendor-misc';
  }
  
  // Feature-based chunks for better caching
  if (id.includes('Timeline') || id.includes('AntimicrobialResistance')) {
    return 'feature-timeline';
  }
  if (id.includes('Protein') && (id.includes('Visualization') || id.includes('Engineering'))) {
    return 'feature-protein';
  }
  
  return null;
}
```

### Critical CSS Strategy

```css
/* Inlined critical CSS for immediate rendering */
body {
  font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, 'Inter', sans-serif;
  font-display: swap;
  -webkit-font-smoothing: antialiased;
  -moz-osx-font-smoothing: grayscale;
}

.hero {
  min-height: 100vh;
  contain: layout style paint;
}

img {
  content-visibility: auto;
  contain-intrinsic-size: 0 200px;
}
```

### Memory Leak Detection Integration

```typescript
// React component with memory leak detection
function MyComponent() {
  const { trackEventListener, trackTimeout, trackObserver } = 
    useMemoryLeakDetector('MyComponent');
  
  useEffect(() => {
    const handler = () => { /* ... */ };
    window.addEventListener('resize', handler);
    trackEventListener(handler);
    
    return () => window.removeEventListener('resize', handler);
  }, [trackEventListener]);
}
```
