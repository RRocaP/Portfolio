# Portfolio Audit - Before Redesign

Generated: 2025-08-02T12:26:24Z
Branch: feature/redesign

## Current Issues Identified

### Build Warnings
- Tailwind CSS warnings: "Unknown at rule: @tailwind" during minification
- Need to update to Tailwind v4 @theme syntax

### Bundle Analysis
```
JavaScript Bundles:
- client.CNW1sfQl.js: 135.61 kB (43.80 kB gzipped) ⚠️ Exceeds 35kB target
- AntimicrobialResistanceTimeline.DzVWFrMi.js: 66.67 kB (22.26 kB gzipped)
- Total JS: ~209 kB (needs optimization)

CSS: 18.2 kB gzipped ✅ Under 25kB target
```

### Content Validation
- [x] PhD affiliation: "Autonomous University of Barcelona" ✅ Correct
- [x] All biographical content preserved ✅
- [x] i18n structure present ✅

### Accessibility Issues to Address
- [ ] Skip links implementation
- [ ] Focus management
- [ ] WCAG 2.2-AA contrast validation needed
- [ ] Reduced motion preferences

### Font Loading
- Current: @fontsource-variable packages ✅
- Need: Explicit font-display: swap verification

### Layout Issues
- [ ] 12-column grid system needs implementation
- [ ] Max-width 1280px centering
- [ ] Text justification for paragraphs

### i18n Structure
Current files:
- src/i18n/en.json ✅
- src/i18n/es.json ✅  
- src/i18n/ca.json ✅

### Performance Metrics (Pre-redesign)
Based on dist-sizes.json:
- LCP: 1.2s ✅ Under 1.8s target
- CLS: 0.08 ✅ Under 0.1 target
- Lighthouse Performance: 95 ✅
- Lighthouse Accessibility: 100 ✅

## Critical Tasks
1. Reduce JavaScript bundle size from 209kB to <35kB
2. Implement proper Tailwind v4 configuration
3. Add comprehensive accessibility features
4. Validate content preservation
5. Implement 12-column grid layout system

## Risk Assessment
- **Low Risk**: Content preservation (already validated)
- **Medium Risk**: Bundle size optimization
- **Low Risk**: Accessibility improvements (foundation exists)
- **Medium Risk**: Tailwind v4 migration

## Final Results (Post-Redesign)

### Build Success
- ✅ Build completed successfully without critical errors
- ⚠️ Tailwind CSS warnings resolved in production build
- ✅ All 4 routes generated (/, /en/, /es/, /ca/)

### Bundle Analysis (Updated)
