# Fire-Shadow Colossus — Shot 1 of 4

**Scene Setting:** Low-angle reveal as the colossus rises from a lava lake.

**Creature Design:** The colossus emerges with charred volcanic armor veined by molten fissures; a mane of flame spills from its neck, shadow-wings unfurl with ember edges, and a whip of living flame coils around its arm.

**Environment:** Volcanic cavern with jagged basalt columns, slow lava flows casting orange reflections, falling debris, drifting ash, and shafts of light piercing the smoky roof.

**Lighting:** Volumetric beams cut through ash, rim lighting traces the armor silhouette, internal glow pulses beneath fissures, and reflections shimmer on molten rock.

**Camera:** 24 mm lens at ground level tilting upward; slow dolly backward to reveal full height; shallow depth of field with foreground rocks blurred; subtle motion blur and quake-like shake.

**Sound:** Deep cavernous rumble, crackling mane, distant rock collapses.

**Duration:** ~6 seconds.

**Style:** Photorealistic VFX with cinematic grading and physically simulated lava, smoke, and fire.

**Reference:** High-budget fantasy epic, emphasizing low-angle emergence to convey immense scale.

**Constraints:** Avoid clipped highlights, texture popping, and misaligned shadows or reflections.
