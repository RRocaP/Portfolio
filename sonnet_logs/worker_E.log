Service Worker implementation completed with the following features:

- **Versioned caches** (`v1.0.0`) with automatic cleanup of old cache versions
- **Stale-while-revalidate** strategy for HTML pages 
- **Cache-first** strategy for static assets (images, CSS, JS, fonts)
- **Offline fallback** page support
- **Safe update flow** with `skipWaiting()` and `clients.claim()`
- **Background sync** for contact forms (disabled by default for GitHub Pages)
- **Proper exclusions** for API routes, source maps, and browser extensions
- **Client messaging** for cache management and version queries
- **IndexedDB integration** for background sync queuing (when enabled)
- **Feature flags** to control functionality based on hosting environment

The service worker is production-ready for GitHub Pages static hosting while providing extensibility for future serverless deployments.
