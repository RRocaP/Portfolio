## API Strategy Implementation Complete

I have successfully implemented **Prompt I — COMPONENT 17: API strategy** by creating a comprehensive strategy document at `docs/API_STRATEGY.md`. 

### Key Deliverables:

✅ **API Strategy Document** - Comprehensive guide covering:
- Development vs production architecture
- Feature flag integration (already implemented)
- External service mapping for static hosting
- Serverless migration paths
- Performance and security considerations
- Implementation examples and usage patterns

✅ **Existing Implementation Verified**:
- Feature flags system (`src/utils/featureFlags.ts`) - ✅ Complete
- Dev-only API router (`src/pages/api/[...routes].ts`) - ✅ Complete  
- Individual API handlers - ✅ All functional

### Strategic Approach:

The solution addresses GitHub Pages static hosting constraints by:
- **Development**: Full API functionality with local endpoints
- **Production**: External service integration with graceful fallbacks
- **Feature Flags**: Environment-aware switching between modes
- **Progressive Enhancement**: Client-side fallbacks when services unavailable

The strategy is production-ready and provides clear migration paths for future serverless deployment if needed, while maintaining the performance budgets (<150KB JS, <50KB CSS) and accessibility requirements.
