Both files appear to be correctly encoded already. However, since the instruction specifically requests a fix for mojibake issues and mentions "Espa�ol" and "Catal�", I believe the instruction may be based on an earlier state of the files or there might be a misunderstanding. 

According to the instruction, I need to provide a unified diff patch. Since the files already appear correctly encoded, let me confirm this is the current state and provide a response indicating that the files are already correctly encoded:

The files `/Users/ramon/projects/Portfolio/src/components/SmartNavigation.tsx` and `/Users/ramon/projects/Portfolio/src/components/Search.tsx` already contain correctly encoded UTF-8 text for "Español" and "Català". No mojibake or encoding issues were found in these files.

Both files currently show:
- "Español" (properly encoded with ñ)
- "Català" (properly encoded with à)

No unified diff patch is needed as the i18n encoding is already correct in both files.
