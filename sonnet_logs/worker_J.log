I've implemented a comprehensive E2E test suite for the portfolio with the following features:

## Test Coverage

### Navigation Behavior Tests
- **Scroll-based navigation show/hide**: Tests auto-hide behavior on scroll down and show on scroll up
- **Scroll progress indicator**: Validates progress bar updates correctly with page scroll
- **Language switching**: Tests multilingual navigation between en/es/ca
- **Anchor navigation**: Tests smooth scrolling to page sections

### Search Interaction Tests  
- **Search modal interaction**: Tests search trigger, input focus, and results display
- **Keyboard navigation**: Tests arrow keys and escape to close
- **Empty search handling**: Tests graceful handling of empty queries

### Contact Form Tests
- **Field validation**: Tests required field validation and email format validation
- **Form submission**: Tests successful submission with mocked API responses
- **Spam protection**: Tests honeypot field visibility (should be hidden)

### Accessibility Tests
- **Axe-core integration**: Runs WCAG 2.1 AA compliance checks on multiple pages
- **Heading hierarchy**: Validates proper H1-H6 structure
- **Focus management**: Tests keyboard navigation and visible focus indicators
- **Reduced motion support**: Tests prefers-reduced-motion behavior

### Performance Budget Tests
- **JavaScript bundle size**: Monitors JS payload against 150KB budget
- **CSS bundle size**: Monitors CSS payload against 50KB budget  
- **Load time budget**: Tests page load under 3 seconds
- **Core Web Vitals**: Measures LCP and CLS for performance

### Mobile Responsiveness
- **Mobile navigation**: Tests hamburger menu functionality
- **Viewport constraints**: Ensures no horizontal scrolling
- **Touch gestures**: Tests swipe interactions on carousels

### Lighthouse CI Integration
- Provides configuration scaffold for automated Lighthouse audits
- Documents expected performance scores (â‰¥95 for all categories)

## Key Features

1. **Robust selector strategy**: Uses multiple selector patterns to find elements reliably
2. **Network interception**: Mocks API calls for isolated testing
3. **Performance monitoring**: Real-time resource size and timing measurement
4. **Accessibility-first**: Comprehensive a11y testing with axe-core
5. **Multi-language testing**: Covers all three language variants (en/es/ca)
6. **CI-ready**: Configured for headless execution with proper timeouts and retries

The tests are designed to run in parallel across multiple browsers and include helper functions for common patterns like measuring layout shifts and resource sizes.
